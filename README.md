### Hey!

My name's Jon! I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2023 and now work as a software engineer.

### Pinned Projects
- `aoc-2025`. Functional language compiler written in Python. Compiles to C. See: https://jta.sh/posts/compiling-functional-languages/
- `kademlia-c`. Kademlia distributed hash table protocol in C. Uses libuv for asynchronous I/O.
- `edit`. Collaborative text editor using CRDTs and a self-hosted server. WIP, based on my `sae` project in college.
- `cfix`. Tag-value FIX protocol parser. Uses a virtual memory trick to make a cool ring buffer (C-strings work across the end!).
- `jontab.github.io`. Personal website and blog. Visit it at https://jta.sh.
